    <h1>Monday Motivation</h1>

    <p>
Do it scared, because if you don't, you will never do it.
If you wait for the perfect time, the  perfect time will never come. Just do it,
 the universe will catch you up, always. 
Start now and stop procrastinating, the best time was years back, the next best time is NOW 
</p>

<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum</h1>

<p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p> 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text evevr since the 1500s,
 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
  sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
